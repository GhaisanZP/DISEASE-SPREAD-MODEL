# DISEASE-SPREAD-MODEL
A simulation will model disease spread in a population. At the start, individuals have a 10%-90% chance of being susceptible, while non-susceptible ones have a 20%-50% chance of becoming infectious. The simulation begins with a mix of susceptible, infectious, and immune individuals, using a probabilistic transmission model.
